# No, it's not "patched"
I've seen a lot of people say that this method has been patched or something. It's not. It still works (people are still getting the badge from it), if you're unable to get the badge after 24 hours or more of waiting, you're probably affected by the issue I mentioned below.

# Requirements
- Discord Bot (https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Discord server that you own
  - (Optional if you want to use source code) Python 3.6 or above

## Usage
1.  Download the repository

2.  Download the requirments by doing in command prompt:

    pip install requests
    pip install discord.py
    pip install requests

3. Paste your Discord token by copying it and right-clicking on the application to paste (or `CTRL + V`, some support it) and **DO NOT** share the token, please.
   - Note that to make it respond to your commands, you will need to keep the application/script window alive as it is what runs the bot to begin with. After you are done with everything, you can safely just close it.
4. When the bot has logged in, copy the invite link given to you by highlighting the URL and right-clicking, then go to a browser and paste the URL.
5. Invite the bot in to your server
6. Use the `/hello` command provided to you
   - **NOTE:** I recommend using an alt account to do this step, you do not have to, however it is best to do it, just to be safe.
7. Enter to https://discord.com/developers/active-developer and claim your badge.
   - It might take 24 hours before you are able to claim at all, so please take time to wait a bit if that is the case.
